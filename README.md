This was a fun assignment to do as the lab documentation helped make sure I knew what I was doing at every step and the final result is a program that actually has tangible function.
I was confused about async functions and fetch until I started working, putting them into practice really helped me understand them.

About 1 hour


## Discussion Questions:
1. What does the bootstrap `display-4` class do?
The display-4 class changes the font size and font weight of the text in whichever container it's used in.
